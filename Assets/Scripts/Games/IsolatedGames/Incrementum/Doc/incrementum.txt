FRAMEWORK CHANGES

instntly eliminate species with only 1 subject and rating = 0

dynamically calculate resource amount cap by just taking most expensive building with that cost for that resource
dynamically calculate income amount cap by just iterating through all upgrade effects and applying them if > 0

add to elimination logic so species are eliminated if they are not improving max fitness for x turns (should replace ranking logic from now but keep it in as an option)


UI CHANGES

clicking on a square in grid ranking should show neural net in closable popupwindow (like play)

hovering a species in scoreboard shows a window over generation stats showing "Species stats", which shows
	- best performer of species
	- median performer of species
	- species representative genome over graphs on the right



UPGRADE CHANGES

add an upgrade that gives a x% improvement to gold income (applied after all additive bonuses)

add an upgrade that instantly gives you x of a resource

add an upgrade that doesn't have any direct effects but gives access to other more powerful upgrades

add an upgrade that can be acquired an unlimited amount of times (doesn't need IsAcquired input, rest should work unchanged)
	- for example "Trade" (cost 100 wood -> receive 50 stone, requirement: marketplace, no resource income modifiers)
	- these kind of upgrades are not allowed to have a resource income modifier effect (because isAcquired isn't tracked)
